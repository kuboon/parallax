/**
 * A client component ("island"): server-rendered to HTML like everything else, then hydrated in the
 * browser so it becomes interactive.
 *
 * `island(name, exportName, component)` marks it for hydration. The name is this file's path under
 * `islands/`, and the runtime resolves it to the chunk the bundler emitted — so nothing here has to
 * know the deploy prefix or predict an output filename.
 *
 * Every click also lands in the {@link clicks} store, which `total.tsx` — a *separate* entrypoint —
 * reads. That the two agree is the visible proof that the shared module was emitted once.
