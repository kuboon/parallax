# pages

A static-site starter built with [Remix v3](https://remix.run) — `remix/ui` for
rendering — and [`@kuboon/remix-ssg`](https://jsr.io/@kuboon/remix-ssg) for
everything around it. The output is plain HTML that deploys to GitHub Pages:
zero client-side JavaScript by default, with opt-in interactivity through
hydrated islands.

## How it works

`router.ts` composes three directories into one handler:

|            |                                           |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `islands/` | compiled as a single code-split bundle    |
| `pages/`   | served through this site's own transforms |
| `static/`  | served verbatim                           |

`deno serve router.ts` runs that handler as the dev server. The build drives the
very same object with `fetch()`, writes each response to disk, and follows the
links it finds — so what you see locally is what gets generated, and moving to a
live server would be a change of deploy target rather than of code.

There is no build script in this repository. `deno task build` runs the
generator straight from JSR.

## Requirements

[Deno](https://deno.com) 2.x.

## Commands

```sh
deno task dev     # local dev server at http://localhost:8000
deno task build   # generate the static site into dist/
deno task check   # type-check, lint, and format-check
```

Neither task passes `-A` or `--unstable-bundle`. `deno.json` carries a
permission set for each (`-P=dev`, `-P=build`) and the `"unstable": ["bundle"]`
the bundler needs — which is also why `deno task build` names `-c deno.json`: a
remote main module reads a project's config only when it is told to.

## Project layout

```
pages/
  deno.json          # tasks, imports, permission sets, compiler + JSX options
  deno.lock          # pinned dependency versions (committed)
  router.ts          # the wiring — three directories into one handler
  layout.tsx         # the HTML document shell
  transforms/
    markdown.tsx     # .md  → an article page
    page.tsx         # .tsx → a page module
  lib/
    base.ts          # the deploy prefix, computed once
    articles.ts      # front-matter for the blog
    markdown.ts      # Markdown → a Remix UI tree (@kuboon/md)
    link.tsx         # internal <Link> (full-document navigation)
  pages/
    index.tsx        # home — places both islands
    about.tsx
    blog/
      index.tsx      # lists the articles beside it
      *.md           # the articles
  islands/
    counter.tsx      # a hydrated island, and its own browser entrypoint
    total.tsx        # a second island/entrypoint, sharing state with it
    store.ts         # the module both islands import — the shared singleton
  static/            # files served under /static/* (favicon, CSS, images…)
```

## Adding a page

Drop a file in `pages/` and link to it.

- A `.md` file becomes an article at its path, rendered by
  `transforms/markdown.tsx`.
- A `.tsx` file exports a component (and optionally `title`, `description`, and
  the `islands` it places), rendered by `transforms/page.tsx`.

The crawl starts at `entryPoints` in `router.ts` and follows links, so **what is
reachable is what gets generated**. A page nothing links to belongs in
`entryPoints`, or it is not part of the site.

That is also why `pages/blog/index.tsx` reads the `.md` files beside it: listing
them is what makes them reachable.

## Markdown content

Each article is a `.md` file under `pages/blog/` with `title`, `date`, and
`summary` front-matter:

```markdown
---
title: Hello, remix-ssg
date: "2026-07-21"
summary: How this site is rendered to static HTML at build time.
---

Body starts here…
```

`transforms/markdown.tsx` turns it into a page: front-matter via
`@std/front-matter`, the body via [`@kuboon/md`](https://jsr.io/@kuboon/md) —
GitHub-flavored, sanitized, with heading anchors and Shiki-highlighted code. The
generator never sees Markdown; that transform and its dependencies are this
site's, which is what keeps them out of the generator.

## Interactive islands (client components)

Most of the site is static HTML. When you need interactivity, use an **island**:
a component that is server-rendered like everything else, then hydrated in the
browser. See `islands/counter.tsx`.

To add one:

1. Write it in `islands/` with `island('name', 'Export', …)` from
   `@kuboon/remix-ssg/client`, where the name is the file's path under
   `islands/` without the extension. Call `handle.update()` after changing
   state.
2. Import it into a `.tsx` page and place it.
3. Name it in that page's `islands` export, so the shell loads its chunk.

A page that names no island ships no `<script>` at all — the article pages have
none.

### How the client code is compiled

Every island is a browser entrypoint, and all of them go into a _single_
`Deno.bundle({ codeSplitting: true })` call. A module more than one of them
imports comes out **once**, in a chunk they share:

```
islands/counter.js ─┬─→ chunk-…   the Remix UI runtime, the ssg client runtime, store.ts
islands/total.js  ──┘
```

The home page demonstrates why that matters. `counter.tsx` and `total.tsx` are
separate entrypoints that never reference each other; both import
`islands/store.ts`, and the running total tracks the buttons only because that
store was emitted once. Compile the entries independently — one bundler call
each — and each gets a private copy, so the total would sit at zero.

There is no client runtime entrypoint to declare: the runtime rides in the chunk
the islands share and starts itself. An island's id is a logical name
(`island:counter#Counter`) rather than a URL, because that expression is
evaluated in the browser too, where predicting the bundler's output naming —
which shifts with the set of entrypoints — would be guesswork. The shell embeds
the name→chunk map the bundler produced and the runtime resolves against it.

Internal links use the `<Link>` component (`lib/link.tsx`), which marks them for
full-document navigation so pages with an active client runtime still navigate
like a normal static site.

## Base paths and GitHub Pages

A GitHub Pages _project_ site is served under a sub-path
(`https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`), and per-PR previews add a further segment.
`lib/base.ts` turns the `BASE_URL` the deploy workflow sets into that prefix;
the shell, the pages and the router all read it from there, and the build strips
it back off when writing so the output always lands at `dist/`'s root.

Locally `BASE_URL` is unset and the site is served from `/`. To preview a
sub-path deployment:

```sh
BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/remix3-ssg-gh-pages deno task dev
```

`deno serve` prints the root URL, but with `BASE_URL` set the site lives under
the prefix — open <http://localhost:8000/remix3-ssg-gh-pages>.

### Which file answers which URL

GitHub Pages serves `/about` from `about.html`, and 404s `/about/` when only
that file exists. `router.ts` states that rule as `fileServer = githubPages()`,
and the same object does two jobs: the build writes the file that rule would
reach for, and `serveAsHost` makes the dev server resolve requests the way the
deploy will — so a trailing slash that 404s in production 404s locally too.

Deploying somewhere with different rules is a matter of passing a different
behavior.

Deployment is wired up in `.github/workflows/pages.yml` at the repository root.
