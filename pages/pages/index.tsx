          Both controls below are server-rendered like every other page, then
          hydrated in the browser — view source and you'll find them already in

          They are <em>separate browser entrypoints</em>{" "}
          that never talk to each other. Each one imports the same click store,
          and the running total keeps up because the bundler emitted that store
          once, into a chunk they share. Compile the two entries independently
          and each gets a private copy — the total would sit at zero forever.
